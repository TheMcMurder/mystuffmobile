=============
This application was part of a class project to pull customer pictures from a server where they were stored at base64 strings.  It was quite a challenge and the code needs to be cleaned up before it goes into any sort of production environment.

This code was open sourced but should not be copied by anyone for use in a similar or identical class assignment without consent of the original author.
